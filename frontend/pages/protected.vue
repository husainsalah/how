<p>DETROIT, MI — House of Wadjet Records: Ancient Future Music, continues to push boundaries with its third release, “Don’t Leave Me EP," by Insane Who Sane and featuring a remix by John Beltran, aka Indio. This latest offering further cements the label's commitment to "Ancient Future Music" while exploring new sonic territories that blend techno, ambient textures, and electronic soul. Following the success of the genre-blurring "Keep Pushin Aun EP," Insane Who Sane returns to his techno roots with a single that can only be described as a dance floor banger, showcasing his evolving artistry and the label's distinctive sound.</p>
<p>The EP opens with "Don't Leave Me," an infectious dance floor anthem that pulses at a commanding 134 BPM. Built upon the foundation of a 909 kick, the track comes alive with groovy toms and a hypnotic bass line that immediately commands attention. Insane Who Sane masterfully weaves in string arrangements and vocal samples from Teddy Pendergrass's disco classic of the same name, creating a bridge between eras that feels both reverent and revolutionary. The track pays homage to techno's disco origins while channeling the raw energy and innovation of Detroit legends like Robert Hood and Underground Resistance, resulting in a composition that honors the past while pushes into the future.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the release comes in two forms with "Chase You." The Indio remix, crafted by acclaimed producer John Beltran, transforms the original composition into a Detroit techno classic, taking you on a deep and hard emotional quest while adding layers of sophisticated arrangement and textural depth. Beltran's expertise shines through in his ability to re-contextualize the source material, creating a version that stands as both a respectful interpretation and a bold reimagining.</p>
<p>The Original Mix of "Chase You" serves as the EP's commanding finale, presenting Insane Who Sane's unfiltered vision in its most potent form. This track epitomizes the "Ancient Future Music" ethos through its seamless fusion of timeless melodies and cutting-edge production techniques. Anchored by the North African inspired broken beat that has become a signature element of Insane Who Sane's sound, the composition draws from powerful sources: Max Romeo's dub classic "Chase the Devil" and Eddy Hazel's "California Dreaming." These samples transform the track into something greater than its parts—a meditation on the universal quest for liberation and justice that resonates across cultures and generations. The result is a profound homage to Black musical heritage while simultaneously pushing the boundaries of contemporary electronic music, creating a listening experience that feels both deeply rooted and boundary-breaking.</p>
<p>Mastered at Sonic Impact by Scott Radke and manufactured by Archer Pressing, the “Don’t Leave Me EP" maintains the high production standards that House of Wadjet Records has established. The release demonstrates the label's continued evolution while staying true to its core mission of creating music that transcends traditional genre boundaries.</p>
<p>This three-track journey represents another significant step forward for both Insane Who Sane as an artist and House of Wadjet Records as a platform for innovative electronic music. The EP reinforces the label's position as a vital voice in the intersection between Detroit's electronic music heritage and global underground culture.</p>
